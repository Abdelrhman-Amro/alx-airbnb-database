# Unnormalized Form (NF0)
- The data is presented as a collection of attributes without structure or organization.
---
# First Normal Form (NF1)
- All attributes are atomic.
- Each table already represents a relation with unique primary keys.
---
# Second Normal Form (NF2)
- All non-key attributes are fully functionally dependent on the primary key.
- Tables already comply because each attribute relates to its primary key and no composite keys exist.
---
# Third Normal Form (NF3)
- There are no transitive dependencies
